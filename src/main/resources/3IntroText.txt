Your godfather, Sirius Black was falsely accused of helping your parent's murder and was imprisoned. But he escaped from Azkaban and now dementors are roaming England looking for him.
You are finally reunited with him, when the dementors find you. There are 15 of them, you are overpowered and your chances of survival are slim.
Your only hope is a new spell you learned, Expecto Patronum, but it is advanced magic, and you don't fully master it yet.
