You're already in fourth year !
This year is a special one in Hogwarts, as it hosts the Triwizard tournament ! The three european schools of magic are competing in this contest, and a champion must be chosen to represent them.
The competition is known to be extremely dangerous, and you feel that you've had your fair share of danger during the last three years. Even if you wanted to participate, you wouldn't be able to, as underage students cannot enroll.
The three champions are chosen by the goblet of fire, and as everyone is celebrating their champion, a fourth name is spat out by the goblet. It is yours, of course. You have no choice but to participate.
You and the other champions survive to the first two task of the competition.
Tou reach the end of the final task along with Hogwart's champion, Cedrig Diggory. As you reach for the cup, you realise it is in fact a portkey, and you are transported to a graveyard, where the dark lord's assistant is waiting for you, to resurrect Voldemort.
Cedric Diggory is quickly killed, and the dark lord resurrected.
Your only hope is to reach the portkey, but Peter Pettigrew is standing in your way.
