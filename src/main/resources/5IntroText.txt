* THE ORDER OF PHOENIX *
***************************

After last year's tragic events, the minister of magic has chosen a peculiar plan of action : he denies everything and accuses Dumbledore of lying in order th overthrow him.
Dumbledore was thus deposed of his function of Headmaster, and Dolores Umbridge is appointed in his place.
But she turns out to be a cruel tyrant and rules Hogwarts with an iron fist.
You and the others students train in secret to compensate the lack of useful classes, when George and Fred Weasley approach you : they have a great idea to disturb the OWL (Ordinary Wizard Level) exam.
They just need you to distract her long enough so that they can set up the fireworks...
