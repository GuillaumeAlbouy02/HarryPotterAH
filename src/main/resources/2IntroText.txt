* THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS  *
***************************

You return to Hogwarts after the summer break, hoping that this year will be less eventful than the last.
Unfortunately, strange things begin to happen. You start speaking with snakes, Filches' cat is petrified, Nearly Headless Nick is petrified and Colin, a student, is petrified. Also, Ginny Weasley is missing.
After a quick investigation, you discover the location of the Chamber of Secrets, where she is kept by a Basilisk controlled by the dark lord you defeated last year.
